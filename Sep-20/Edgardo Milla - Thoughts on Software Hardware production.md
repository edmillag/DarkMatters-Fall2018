I was not getting stuck into the reading until when it was clear the historic origin of the abusive male culture into the software production process, i’ve never realized how intimate this process is related to the sexist operative model of actual deprecated institutions, like the priesthood, military or academia. I totally agree with the final conclusion about we can not destroy what happened in the last century in terms of software or hardware development, but we can think about it. Actually we are making our everyday live over devices that encapsulate hundred years over abuses and non appropriates conducts, over woman, poor people or environment overabuse . So the question is on me,  is a political decision, how we keep the technological advances but trying to clean that abuses?, like a generation we still having the chance to make thinks different from a historical stereotype. Going deeper, can we fix that, opening more positions to womens as leaders?, can we fix that, erasing parts of hardware or software build over abuse? I see that obvious question very unlikely. What about make new methods of start developing software, like a starting point over the recent conscient culture, and over the intimacy of both, hw and sw as a transparency machine, near enough to the transparency between networks, devices or physical action, ie: iCloud. Maybe Apple in that instance is a paradox, hardware and software guided by only one will, building over deprecated ways of thinking, but, what if we will reign that will?, without surveillance, without economic class or racial bias?, without the learning curve as a step for old generations?. Sounds like a something doable
