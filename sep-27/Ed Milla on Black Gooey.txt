I agree when American adopt as an epic the construction of a white GUI in detriment of the minorities, or as a condensed history about how a bunch of liberalist and capitalist from Silicon Valley found a way to keep the rest of us not thinking in the political potential of technology as a weapon to make safe their own class and race old privileges.

I can understand, that can be other parallel narratives behind that, for instance, the skeuomorphism of the writer's block when the white paper page becomes a pain and a barrier to start something new.

Despite all the infinite narratives, id like to keep thinking about the idea that technology and is very end is a liberating force that can push us over our own boundaries, in some part this is the force that bring me to this city out of my confort place, the technology, but the humanity that resides on it
